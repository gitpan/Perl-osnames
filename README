NAME
    Perl::osnames - List possible $^O ($OSNAME) values, with description

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.11 of Perl::osnames (from Perl
    distribution Perl-osnames), released on 2014-12-19.

DESCRIPTION
    This package contains $data which lists possible values of $^O along
    with description for each. It also provides some helper functions.

  Tags
    *   unix

        Unix-like operating systems. This currently excludes beos/haiku.

    *   bsd

        BSD-derived Unix operating systems.

    *   sysv

        SysV-derived Unix operating systems.

    *   posix

        For POSIX-compliant OSes, including fully-, mostly-, and
        largely-compliant ones (source:
        <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX>).

        From what I can gather, dec_osf is not POSIX compliant, although
        there is a posix package for it.

VARIABLES
    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

  $data
    An arrayref of records (arrayrefs), each structured as:

     [$name, \@tags, $description]

FUNCTIONS
    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

  is_posix([ $os ]) => bool
    Check whether $os (defaults to $^O if not specified) is POSIX (checked
    by the existence of "posix" tag on the OS's record in $data). Will
    return 0, 1, or undef if $os is unknown.

  is_unix([ $os ]) => bool
    Check whether $os (defaults to $^O if not specified) is Unix (checked by
    the existence of "unix" tag on the OS's record in $data). Will return 0,
    1, or undef if $os is unknown.

SEE ALSO
    perlvar

    Config

    Perl::OSType, a core module. You should probably use this module
    instead. Currently the difference between this module and Perl::osnames:
    1) Perl::osnames currently doesn't list beos/haiku as Unix, but POSIX;
    2) Perl::osnames provides more tags (like sysv, bsd, posix) and
    description.

    Devel::Platform::Info

    The output of "perl -V"

    App::osnames, the original reason for Perl::osnames. With this CLI tool
    you can grep OS names by name, tag, or description, e.g. "osnames
    solaris" or "osnames posix".
