NAME
    Perl::osnames - List possible $^O ($OSNAME) values, with description

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.08 of Perl::osnames (from Perl
    distribution Perl-osnames), released on 2014-12-18.

DESCRIPTION
    This package contains $data which lists possible values of $^O along
    with description for each.

  Tags
    *   unix

        Unix-like operating systems. This currently excludes beos/haiku.

    *   bsd

        BSD-derived Unix operating systems.

    *   sysv

        SysV-derived Unix operating systems.

    *   posix

        For POSIX-compliant OSes, including fully-, mostly-, and
        largely-compliant ones (source:
        <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX>).

        From what I can gather, dec_osf is not POSIX compliant, although
        there is a posix package for it.
